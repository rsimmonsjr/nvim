# nvim
Neovim Configuration that I use in my daily work. This is proided here as a backup and as a
reference for those that are interested in making neovim work for them as a development 
environment. Readers are encouraged to borrow from the config to build their own neovim but 
just using it wholesale will rob you of the experience of knowing vim. This repository will 
forever be a work in progress as i tinker with key bindings, plugins and so on.
